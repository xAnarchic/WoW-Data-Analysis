# WoW-Data-Analysis
Data analysis project on World of Warcraft raiding data.


Technology used: GraphQL, Python, SQL, Power Bi. 


I utilised Python to: query data from a publicly available API via GraphQL that hosts World of Warcraft raiding data, clean and organise the data, and subsequently import the data into MySqlWorkbench. I leveraged SQL to perform further cleaning of the imported data, as well as create novel IDs to correspond with each player name in the dataset. Lastly, I used Power Bi to visualise the data imported from MySQLWorkbench where the use of IDs avoided player name duplication. This enabled me to avoid player name duplication in the dataset, improving visualisation performance in Power Bi.


This project provided me the opportunity to learn about how to: query via GraphQL, clean data using both Python and SQL, collect and organise data into dataframes ready for import into MySQLWorkbench, and visualise this data for easier identification of trends in Power Bi.
