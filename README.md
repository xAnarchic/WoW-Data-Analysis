How It's Made:
Tech used: GraphQL, Python, SQL, Power Bi. 

I utilised Python to: query data from a publicly available API via GraphQL that hosts World of Warcraft raiding data, clean and organise the data, and subsequently import the data into MySqlWorkbench. I leveraged SQL to perform further cleaning of the imported data, as well as create novel IDs to correspond with each player name in the dataset. Lastly, I used Power Bi to visualise the data imported from MySQLWorkbench where the use of IDs avoided player name duplication. This enabled me to avoid player name duplication in the dataset, improving visualisation performance in Power Bi.


Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or wow I actually did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
