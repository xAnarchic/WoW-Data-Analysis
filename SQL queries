SQL queries - performed on MySQLWorkbench.

Queries used to create a unique, novel player ID that corresponds to a single player.

1) 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS playerids AS 
	SELECT DISTINCT `Names` players
	FROM parses;

2)
ALTER TABLE playerids
ADD  ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT KEY FIRST;


Queries used to clean data in existing tables through the removal of any row duplicates. Each query relates to an existing table that tracks a specific player metric (buffs, deaths, consumables, and parses). 

1)
CREATE TABLE finalbuffs AS
    SELECT DISTINCT *
	FROM buffs b
	JOIN playerids ON Names = players
	ORDER BY ID, Names ASC;

2)
CREATE TABLE finaldeaths AS
    SELECT DISTINCT *
	FROM deaths d
	JOIN playerids ON Names = players
	ORDER BY ID, Names ASC;

3)
CREATE TABLE finalconsumables AS
    SELECT DISTINCT *
	FROM consumables c
	JOIN playerids ON Names = players
	ORDER BY ID, Names ASC;

4)
CREATE TABLE finalparses AS
    SELECT DISTINCT *
	FROM parses pa
	JOIN playerids ON Names = players
	ORDER BY ID, Names ASC;
